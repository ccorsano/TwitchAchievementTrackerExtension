Changelog, v0.0.3
- Rewrite frontend in React + TypeScript
  Please note that full-code sourcemap are included, code is easiest browsed using Developers Tools through WebPack source mapping.
  Given full source maps are available, I enabled minification to keep the size low for the end users, I can provide the full frontend project upon request.
- Assisted configuration
  Configuration is now a proper React app, enabling for a much better UX.
  It should now be much harder to save an invalid configuration, and the configuration checks if the xapi.us token needs a refresh.

Changelog, v0.0.2
- Redesign: made the base real-estate taken by the extension much smaller, now displays a compact square widget until clicked.
  The extension is also now hidden if the video viewport is reduced, so that in no case the expanded view takes more than 50% of the view.
- Mobile: added mobile views.
  Note: I have not reactivated my Apple Developer Program, and as such only wish to enable mobile support for non-iOS platform for this version.
- Steam achievements support: Configuration now can switch between XBoxLive or Steam, the section marked "[Active]" in the configuration is the one displayed in the extension.
   To configure Steam, the streamer needs to register a free Steam WebAPI key on his account (or have a Steamworks developer account to get a proper dev WebAPI key).
   The configured Steam profile needs to be configured as public for the EBS to retrieve the achievements.
   A search field is provided on the configuration page to find Steam AppId.
   The streamer is expected to extract their 64bit SteamId from their profile URL.
    In the context of this review, here are some information you can use for testing:
    - Steam WebAPI private key: <APIKEY_HERE>
    - Streamer SteamID: 76561198024910443
    - Game AppId: 232790
    - Locale: english
- Updated screnshots and extension information to reflect the changes
- Bug fixes and improvements, both on the frontend and on the EBS

Initial release from v0.0.1
- XBoxLive api integration
  XBoxLive achievements requires the registration of an https://xapi.us, and to have authenticated with an XBoxLive account on the xapi.us portal.
  Example configuration for review:
  - xapi.us private key: <APIKEY_HERE>
  - Streamer XUID: 2535467661815558
  - TitleId: 1659804324
  - Locale: en-US
- Collapsable view: the extension by default only displays a limited summary of the completion progress.
  Clicking the extension widget expands the view to see more details, including the full achievements list.
