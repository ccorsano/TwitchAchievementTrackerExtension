Changelog, v0.0.3
- Rewrite of frontend in React + TypeScript
  Please note that full-code sourcemap are included, code is easiest browsed using Developers Tools through WebPack source mapping.
  Given full source maps are available, I enabled minification to keep the size low for the end users, I can provide the full frontend project upon request.
- Assisted configuration
  Configuration is now a proper React app, enabling for a much better UX.
  It should now be much harder to save an invalid configuration, and the configuration will checks and give directions if the xapi.us token needs a refresh.
- Reconfiguration support
  You can reconfigure if needed, the extension pushes to pub-sub in case the streamer went live with the wrong config
