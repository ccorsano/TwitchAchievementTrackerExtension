Changelog, v0.0.3
- Rewrite of frontend in React + TypeScript
  Please note that full-code sourcemap are included, code is easiest browsed using Developers Tools through WebPack source mapping.
  I can provide the full frontend project upon request, if the source maps are not enough.
  As the WebPack developer tools might mix Twitch own source with mine, here is the file structure of my react project:
    +-- src
    |   +-- common/            -> Shared types and helpers
    |   +-- components/        -> React components
    |   +-- services/          -> Service classes
    |   +-- Config.tsx         -> Root file for the broadcaster Configuration view
    |   +-- Mobile.tsx         -> Root file for the Mobile viewer Twitch view
    |   +-- VideoOverlay.tsx   -> Root file for the Video Overlay viewer Twitch view
- Assisted configuration
  Configuration is now a proper React app, enabling for a much better UX.
  It should now be much harder to save an invalid configuration, and the configuration will check and give directions if the xapi.us token needs a refresh.
- Reconfiguration support
  You can reconfigure if needed, the extension pushes to pub-sub in case the streamer went live with the wrong config
