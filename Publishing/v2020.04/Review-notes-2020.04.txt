- Frontend is written in React + TypeScript
  Please note that full-code sourcemap are included, code is easiest browsed using Developers Tools through WebPack source mapping.
  I can provide the full frontend project upon request, if the source maps are not enough.
  As the WebPack developer tools might mix Twitch own source with the extension's, here is the file structure of the react project:
    +-- src
    |   +-- common/            -> Shared types and helpers
    |   +-- components/        -> React components
    |   +-- services/          -> Service classes
    |   +-- Config.tsx         -> Root file for the Broadcaster Configuration view
    |   +-- LiveConfig.tsx     -> Root file for the Stream Dashboard view
    |   +-- Mobile.tsx         -> Root file for the Mobile viewer Twitch view
    |   +-- VideoOverlay.tsx   -> Root file for the Video Overlay viewer Twitch view

- On the viewers side, just click the overlay to show the full list of achievements.

- During the live, the Dashboard view allows to force the refresh of the achievement completion on the backend.
  As this can exceed the XApi.us call limit, when configured with an XBoxLive game the live view also displays the current Rate limit and reset period.


Changelog, v2020.04
- Dashboard live config view:
  - Force refresh the achievement list for all viewers, to reflect any new achievement you earned
  - When using xapi.us, see in real time how much API calls you are using, as clicking refresh will use at least one.
- For Steam integration, the extension now uses tiles from the new Steam store when available (looks much better)
- Mask the API key as a password field when editing the config.
  It avoids exposing the key if the config is edited on stream.
